This diagram, created using the Bizagi BPM (Business Process Modeler) tool, depicts the comprehensive admission process for international students at a university. The workflow is divided into multiple lanes representing different entities involved: the student, the admission office, the academic committee, and an academic recognition agency.

# Why I used Business Process Management tool Bizagi

By clearly defining each step and responsible party, BPM ensures that processes are carried out efficiently and consistently. BPM helps organizations comply with industry standards and regulations by standardizing procedures and maintaining documentation. BPM tools like Bizagi provide data and insights that support better decision-making and strategic planning.

# Key Steps in the BPM Model #1 :

1) Student Submits Application:

The student fills out a new admission form online.
The form is recorded in the admission system database.
A PDF version of the form is generated for the student to download, sign, and upload along with additional required documents.


2) Admission Office Receives and Reviews Documents:

The admission office receives the signed form, certified copies of degrees, English language test results, and curriculum vitae (CV).
The office checks the completeness of the documents:
If incomplete, the student is asked to provide the missing documents.
If complete, the certified copies of degrees are sent to the academic recognition agency for validation.

3) Document Validation and Assessment:

The academic recognition agency examines the certified copies of degrees.
If successful, the results are forwarded back to the admission office.
The admission office checks the validity of the English language test results:
If valid, the application is assessed by the academic committee.
If invalid or unverifiable, the application is rejected, and the student is notified.

4) Academic Committee Evaluation:

The academic committee examines the application, considering all submitted documents and the validation results from the academic recognition agency.
The committee checks the assessment and makes a decision:
If the application is successful, the student is notified of the result and sent a confirmation letter.
If unsuccessful, the application is rejected, and the student is notified.
