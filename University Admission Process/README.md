This diagram, created using the Bizagi BPM (Business Process Modeler) tool, depicts the comprehensive admission process for international students at a university. The workflow is divided into multiple lanes representing different entities involved: the student, the admission office, the academic committee, and an academic recognition agency.

# Benefits of Using This Model

Efficiency and Accuracy:

- Streamlined Process: The BPM model eliminates redundancy and streamlines each step, ensuring a smooth flow of information and tasks. This reduces delays and minimizes the risk of errors compared to traditional paper-based processes.
- Automated Notifications: Automated email notifications keep students informed about their application status, reducing uncertainty and the need for manual follow-ups.

Improved Document Management:

- Centralized System: All application data and documents are centralized in an online system, making it easier to track and retrieve information. This contrasts with older methods where documents could be misplaced or take longer to access.
- Digital Verification: Using digital methods for verifying documents (such as degree certificates and English test results) ensures faster and more reliable verification compared to manual checks.

Enhanced Communication:

- Clear Responsibilities: The BPM model clearly defines the roles and responsibilities of each stakeholder (student, admissions office, ABA, AC), ensuring better coordination and communication.
- Timely Feedback: The system provides timely feedback to students about missing or invalid documents, allowing them to quickly address any issues and complete their applications.

Transparency and Accountability:

- Traceability: Each step in the process is documented and traceable, providing transparency and accountability. This is beneficial in resolving any disputes or issues that may arise during the admission process.
- Compliance: Ensuring that all steps are followed in a structured manner helps the university comply with internal policies and external regulations.

Scalability:

- Handling Volume: The BPM model is scalable, allowing the university to efficiently handle a large volume of applications without compromising on quality or speed. This is particularly important during peak admission periods.

# Key Steps in the BPM Model #1 :

1) Student Submits Application:

The student fills out a new admission form online.
The form is recorded in the admission system database.
A PDF version of the form is generated for the student to download, sign, and upload along with additional required documents.


2) Admission Office Receives and Reviews Documents:

The admission office receives the signed form, certified copies of degrees, English language test results, and curriculum vitae (CV).
The office checks the completeness of the documents:
If incomplete, the student is asked to provide the missing documents.
If complete, the certified copies of degrees are sent to the academic recognition agency for validation.

3) Document Validation and Assessment:

The academic recognition agency examines the certified copies of degrees.
If successful, the results are forwarded back to the admission office.
The admission office checks the validity of the English language test results:
If valid, the application is assessed by the academic committee.
If invalid or unverifiable, the application is rejected, and the student is notified.

4) Academic Committee Evaluation:

The academic committee examines the application, considering all submitted documents and the validation results from the academic recognition agency.
The committee checks the assessment and makes a decision:
If the application is successful, the student is notified of the result and sent a confirmation letter.
If unsuccessful, the application is rejected, and the student is notified.
