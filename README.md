This diagram, created using the Bizagi BPM (Business Process Modeler) tool, outlines the detailed admission process for international graduate students at a university. The process is divided into several lanes representing different stakeholders involved in the workflow: the student, the admission office, the internal quality assurance agency (AQA), and the academic committee (AC).

# Why I used Business Process Management tool Bizagi

By clearly defining each step and responsible party, BPM ensures that processes are carried out efficiently and consistently. BPM helps organizations comply with industry standards and regulations by standardizing procedures and maintaining documentation. BPM tools like Bizagi provide data and insights that support better decision-making and strategic planning.

# Key Steps in the BPM Model #1 :

1) Student Initiates Application:

The student opens the online application form and submits the required information.
The information system generates a PDF of the application, which the student downloads, signs, and uploads along with other required documents (e.g., certified copies of degrees, transcripts, English language test results, curriculum vitae, and reference letters).

2) Admission Office Reviews Application:

The admission office receives and checks the documents.
If any documents are missing, the application is incomplete, and the student is notified.
If the application is complete, it is forwarded to the internal quality assurance agency (AQA) for further validation.

3) Validation and Verification:

The AQA checks the validity of the degrees.
The English language test results are verified by an assigned officer.
If the degree and test results are valid, the application proceeds; otherwise, it is rejected, and the student is notified.

4) Academic Committee Review:

The AQA sends all documents to the AC.
The AC reviews the documents, conducts an academic assessment, and makes a decision.
The chair of the AC notifies the admission office of the decision.

5) Final Notifications:

The admission office sends notifications to all candidates, indicating whether they have been admitted or rejected.
Benefits of BPM and Bizagi
Streamlining Processes: BPM provides a visual representation of complex workflows, making it easier to identify bottlenecks, redundancies, and areas for improvement.
